Part 1: Configure the Deployment Server(10.0.7.199)
On the first Linux machine (which will be your deployment server):

a. Navigate to your Splunk installation directory:

bash
cd /opt/splunk/bin
b. Start Splunk (if not already running):

bash
./splunk start
c. Enable the deployment server functionality:

bash
./splunk set deploy-poll 10.0.7.199:8089
d. Create a deployment server configuration file:

bash
touch /opt/splunk/etc/system/local/serverclass.conf
e. Edit the serverclass.conf file (using vi/nano) with basic configuration:

[serverClass:All_Deployment_Clients]
whitelist.0 = *

[serverClass:All_Deployment_Clients:app:your_app_name]
restartSplunkd = true
f. Restart Splunk to apply changes:

bash
./splunk restart

Part 2: Configure the Deployment Client(10.0.7.198)
On the second Linux machine (which will be your client):

a. Navigate to your Splunk installation directory:

bash
cd /opt/splunk/bin
b. Configure the client to connect to the deployment server:

bash
./splunk set deploy-poll 10.0.7.199:8089

c. Restart Splunk on the client:

bash
./splunk restart
===========================================================================================
Part 3: Configure the Deployment Client(10.0.7.7)
On the second Linux machine (which will be your client):

a. Navigate to your Splunk installation directory:

bash
cd /opt/splunk/bin
b. Configure the client to connect to the deployment server:

bash
./splunk set deploy-poll 10.0.7.199:8089

c. Restart Splunk on the client:

bash
./splunk restart
===========================================================================================
Part 3: Verify and Manage Deployment
Back on the deployment server:

a. Check the deployment status:

bash
./splunk list deploy-clients
b. To manage apps and configurations:

Place apps in /opt/splunk/etc/deployment-apps/ on the deployment server

Update serverclass.conf to specify which clients get which apps

Example more advanced serverclass.conf:

[global]
repositoryLocation = /opt/splunk/etc/deployment-apps

[serverClass:Linux_Servers]
whitelist.0 = client-hostname*

[serverClass:Linux_Servers:app:unix_app]
restartSplunkd = true
Access the Web Interface:

Log in to the deployment server's web interface at http://<deployment-server-IP>:8000

Navigate to Settings > Forwarder Management to monitor and manage clients
